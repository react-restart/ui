import WaypointExample from "../src/WaypointExample";

A component (and related hook) to provide a high level interface
over [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
designed to detect when a component enters and exits a viewport.

`Waypoint` provides a good basis for building other components like infinite lists,
"scroll spy" style navigation, lazy loading images, and more.

## How it works

Waypoint renders a "sentinel" element that you place in a scrollable
area. Using an `IntersectionObserver`, the waypoint fires a callback when it
"intersects" with the visible area of the scroll view. Waypoint will fire a callback
when this happens with details about where the waypoint is in relation to the visible
area.

The example below adds visible styling to waypoint for clarity. By default a
waypoint renders an invisible zero-height element.

<WaypointExample scrollIntoView />

## Scroll direction

For simplicity, scroll detection with waypoints is limited to a single direction at one time.
By default that direction is "vertical", but can configured to "horizontal".

```tsx
<Waypoint scrollDirection="horizontal" />
```

<WaypointExample horizontal />

## Specifying the scroll parent

By default waypoint observes scrolling on the device viewport, generally the `window`.
You can also specify a specific element as the root by providing a DOM element
to the `root` prop.

```tsx
function ScrollArea({ items, onPositionChange }) {
  const [element, setElement] = useState<HTMLDivElement>(
    null
  );

  return (
    <div ref={setElement} style={{ overflow: "auto" }}>
      {items}
      <Waypoint
        root={element}
        onPositionChange={onPositionChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Margins

You can adjust the functional shape of the viewport by providing a `rootMargin`
prop, which is passed to the underlying `IntersectionObserver`. As a convenience,
Waypoint accepts an object with inset properties as well as a valid CSS margin property
value.

Positive margins grow the overall size of the viewport causing waypoints to enter
before they are actually in view. Negative values shrink the viewport, and delays
the waypoint from entering by the specified pixel amount. Margins are illustrated
by the yellow blocks in the example below.

Here is an example of positive margins:

```tsx
<Waypoint rootMargin={{ top: 20, bottom: 20 }} />
```

<WaypointExample margins={{ top: 20, bottom: 20 }} />

<p>And the effect with negative margins</p>

```tsx
<Waypoint rootMargin={{ top: -20, bottom: -20 }} />
```

<WaypointExample margins={{ top: -20, bottom: -20 }} />

## `useWaypoint`

The underlying hook powering the Waypoint component. Leverage `useWaypoint`
to turn any component into a waypoint. Using the hook directly is helpful
when you want an individual component to respond

```tsx live
import getScrollParent from "dom-helpers/scrollParent";
import useWaypoint, {
  Position,
} from "@restart/ui/useWaypoint";

function LazyImage({ src }) {
  const [element, attachRef] = useState(null);
  const [hasBeenSeen, setSeen] = useState(false);

  const waypointRef = useWaypoint(
    element,
    ({ position, previousPosition }, entry, observer) => {
      if (hasBeenSeen) {
        return;
      }

      setSeen(position === Position.INSIDE);
    },
    {
      root: "scrollParent",
      scrollDirection: "horizontal",
      rootMargin: { right: -80 },
    }
  );

  return (
    <img
      ref={attachRef}
      style={{
        height: 160,
        width: 160,
        display: "inline-block",
      }}
      // swap out for the real image when it's been seen
      src={hasBeenSeen ? src : ""}
    />
  );
}

<div className="relative py-4">
  <div
    className="absolute border-black border-2 pointer-events-none "
    style={{ top: 0, bottom: 40, left: 0, right: 80 }}
  />
  <div className="overflow-x-scroll h-56 grid grid-flow-col auto-cols-[160px]">
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/237/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/153/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/125/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/74/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/50/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/34/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/12/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/64/160/160" />
    <LazyImage src="https://picsum.photos/id/18/160/160" />
  </div>
</div>;
