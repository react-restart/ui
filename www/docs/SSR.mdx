title: Server Side Rendering
---

All `@restart/ui` components can can be rendered in the browser as well as
on the server, in a compatible NodeJs environment.

## SSR Provider

HTML created on the server by React must be "rehydrated" on the client
in order for components to become interactive. When there are differences
between the server HTML and the client react component tree, React may not
be able to fully hydrate the app and you lose the performance benefits of
doing it in the first place. To ensure that `@restart/ui` components
are correctly rehydrated, wrap your application in a `SSRProvider`
on the server.

```jsx
import { SSRProvider } from "@restart/ui/ssr";

<SSRProvider>
  <App />
</SSRProvider>;
```

In particular this ensures that autogenerated `id` props on components match
between environments.

## useSSRSafeId

You can also make use of restart's `id` generation in your own apps
using `useSSRSafeId`

```jsx
import { useSSRSafeId } from "@restart/ui/ssr";

function Component() {
  const id = useSSRSafeId();
  return <div id={id} />;
}
```
